This is a project me and my friend were creating during our Erasmus+ programme in Finland

Our task was to model a small scale system of the NUVE Project.
## It included two servomotors connected to each other:

-One was controlled by it's torque, which could simulate the vehicle wheel

-The other was velocity-controlled. The velocity came from MEVEA system, which calculated the velocity of the simulating vehicle based on the torque of the vehilces wheel and simulated environment
